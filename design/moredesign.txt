Design:
The problem I was solving was creating a game that was fulfilling and immersive. To do this I created an 3D interface in a 2D interface using pygame by using a lot of math and trig. I referenced Leonel Machava in the math from his rotating cube program. The planets and sun were able to rotate with "3D" behavior. Shading was then added to the planet using a similar method. I first started this project with inspiration from the Monument Valley's pretty platform.  Then I received advice from my roommate to do something with a globe. This is how I came to make this. Please refer to the other documents for the other programs I refered to. The modules I used were pygame and opencv. Pygame was used to make the gui and make the various sprites and surfaces show up in the right order. OpenCV was added afterwards to make the game pause when the face was not detected.
