My project is a game that promotes focus and immersion. The goal of the game is to conquer as many levels as possible by catching comets and planting them into craters. Once all the craters are filled, you move on to the next level.
To play the game, all the modules in the source code must be downloaded.
In addition, the 3rd party modules I used were pygame and opencv.
To download pygame:
	install pip
	type in the command in terminal : pip install pygame
To download opencv:
	install pip
	type in the command in terminal : pip install opencv2
